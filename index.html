			<h1>Oren Wright</h1>
		</header>

		<section>
			<p>I build AI systems that fail gracefully instead of catastrophically. I currently hold a research position at the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu">Software Engineering Institute</a>, and am pursuing a PhD, advised by <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/">José Moura</a> and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ece/learning-control/">Yorie Nakahira</a>.</p>

			<p>I'm not much for "About Me" pages. An ostensive definition of myself: engineering, cooking, poetry, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/0x6f6d77/">photography</a>, Sequoia, Bayes' theorem, doing things the hard way, קהלת. I live in Pittsburgh with my wife and children. I also keep a secret blog.</p>

			<p>You can email me at owright (at) sei (dot) cmu (dot) edu.</p>
