			<p>I'm interested in building AI systems that fail gracefully instead of catastrophically. I'm currently pursuing a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Jos√© Moura and Yorie Nakahira, and hold a research position at the <a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu">CMU Software Engineering Institute</a>.</p>

			<p>I live in Pittsburgh with my wife and daughter. Outside of my technical work, I enjoy cooking, photography, and feats of endurance. I also keep a secret blog.</p>
