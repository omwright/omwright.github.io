			<p>I build AI systems that fail gracefully instead of catastrophically. I currently hold a research position at the Carnegie Mellon University <a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu">Software Engineering Institute</a>, and am pursuing a PhD, advised by José Moura and Yorie Nakahira.</p>

			<p>I'm not much for "About Me" pages. An ostensive definition of myself: engineering, cooking, poetry, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/0x6f6d77/">photography</a>, Sequoia, apple pie, Bayes' theorem, "Sredni Vashtar," doing things the hard way, קֹהֶלֶת. I live in Pittsburgh with my wife and children. I also keep a secret blog.</p>
